### Summary :

    Little C++ project in the DPS (Dead Pixel Society) context. This is all about a 2D game based
    on the dungeon crawler concept. You will be able ton control a little character on a simple
    map with some points of interest. When you reached one of them (a dungeon), you will have 
    a side view (2D plateformer) and you will have to clean the dungeon to unlock some crazy
    stuff and much more. Coming soon, stay tuned !
